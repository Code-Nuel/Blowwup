# Blowwup, A platform where artists connects with fans for funding and networking 

Blowwup is a Web3 social media platform where artists can connect with other professionals who will help their projects succeed and raise money for them.
The Anxilla platform offers a venue where musicians and fans may interact and support each other's careers by purchasing the musician's body of work as well as streaming their music.
The artists can submit a request for funding by uploading a sample of their idea along with a proposal outlining the amount of money required for the project to be successful as well as the advantages the fans are likely to experience. After uploading, supporters can contribute by submitting the project to the artist via their Lukso Universal Profile.

A request for the fund can be made by the artist once the funds match their budget.
This project aims to provide artists with all the resources they needâ€”including money, a support network, expertise, etc.â€”in order to maintain their independence and support themselves directly. Additionally, this is a means for fans to truly invest in an artist from the beginning of their career in a way that has only been possible for a small number of affluent people and businesses since recorded music was invented. 

## Motivation for Blowwup
### Lack of funds
The inability to finance the creation of top-notch music, music video, its promotion, or its branding prevents musicians from reaching a bigger audience. Most musicians lose motivation as a result of this and wind up looking for alternative professional paths.

### Ignorance
Even though some artists are talented, they could find it difficult to put their skills to use because they lack career guidance and knowledge of the music industry, which keeps their songs from being heard by larger audiences.

### Absence of a team
For all musicians, especially those who are new to the music industry, building a team can be challenging. Rising stars could be the ones that suffer the most since they need the appropriate individuals to help them develop their relationships and mentor them in the field.

### Blowwup approach
Through crowdfunding, musicians can create albums, plan tours, and build their brands with amazing success. By soliciting contributions from their fans, crowdfunding grants artists financial and creative flexibility. Through crowdfunding, fans are invited to invest money in their favorite musicians, giving them the chance to get to know them better. Instead of paying a substantial amount to a label, artists can deploy money where it is needed. Artists can generate better music sooner in their careers because to crowdsourcing. Additionally, the influence of label executives who would otherwise choose which songs or works to release is removed.
Blowwup is a platform that allows fans to invest in artist career through crowdfunding.
